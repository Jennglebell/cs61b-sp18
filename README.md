# CS61B-Spring18-Jennglebell
This repo is for my self-learning of data structures and algorithms with the materials provided by CS61B, a fantastic course taught by Josh Hug in UC Berkeley.


I am really grateful for the fact that all the learning materials are made public and accessible to all. 


You can find the course in the [link](https://sp18.datastructur.es/) here.
